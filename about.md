### Welcome to NYCflights13 Time Gained in Flight

Given a flight delayed, what is the likelihood a carrier will make up time in route? Does it have to do well with the origin airport or destination airport? This web application developed with Shiny will allows the user explore the time gained in flights from different points of view.

The data model behind this dashboard is based on flights from NYC airports in 2013, available through the  [nycflights13](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf) package,
